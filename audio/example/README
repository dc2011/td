Openal Examples
===============
Terence Stenvold January 2011

Dependencies
====
	openal
	ogg

For Ubuntu 
    #apt-get install libalut0 libalut-dev libvorbis-dev 

Build
======
    $make

Run
======
To simply play a Ogg file
   $ soundtest 1.ogg play
To do a 10 second loop
   $ soundtest 1.ogg loop
To record and playback sound
   $ soundtest 1.ogg record

Notes
======
When doing a 'record' it ignores the Ogg file passed in and it also records indefinatly so 'CTRL-C' needs to be pressed to exit the program.
